# Object-Detection-with-Federated-Learning

## Background
The Object Detection with Federated Learning project is for giving proof of concept (POC) on the application of federated learning on intelligent connected vehicle networks during my internship at Audi China R&D .
In this projecct, we adpoted Faster R-CNN from the object detection algorithms into Tensorflow Federated (TFF) framework. 

The repository contains:
- Learning tutorials
- installation requirement
- code 
- Augmented VOC2007 and VOC2012 data
